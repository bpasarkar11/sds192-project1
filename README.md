#sds192-project1
Author: Blair Pasarkar 
This is my Project 1. I created four different plots using the MTA Daily 
Ridership Data 2020-2025. The main variable being the bus ridership percentage
compared to pre-pandemic day. I used my graphs in order to see how the MTA 
recovered post-Covid. I also created a video explaining my graphs and conclusions. 
Then I wrote a report which fully analyzed each plot with their findings and 
what that implied as well as the biases and short comings of the plots. 
My repository has four different parts. There are three folders: one called 
"R" which holds the qmd file that contains the codes for the plots, another 
called "data" which holds the original csv file from the NY Government and 
the csv file that I updated for my own usage, the third is "plots" which has 
saved images of my visualizations. The last part that will be in the repository
is the report.
